      <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour, (spooned and leveled)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>
          2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, or vegetable oil 1 large egg 1
          tablespoon vegetable oil Assorted toppings, such as butter, maple
          syrup, confectioners' sugar, honey, jams, preserves, sweetened whipped
          cream, or chocolate syrup
        </li>
      </ul>
      <strong>Instructions</strong>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Preheat oven to 200 degrees; have a baking sheet or heatproof platter
          ready to keep cooked pancakes warm in the oven. In a small bowl, whisk
          together flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt; set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a medium bowl, whisk together milk, butter (or oil), and egg. Add
          dry ingredients to milk mixture; whisk until just moistened (do not
          overmix; a few small lumps are fine).
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat a large skillet (nonstick or cast-iron) or griddle over medium.
          Fold a sheet of paper towel in half, and moisten with oil; carefully
          rub skillet with oiled paper towel.
        </li>
        <li>
          For each pancake, spoon 2 to 3 tablespoons of batter onto skillet,
          using the back of the spoon to spread batter into a round (you should
          be able to fit 2 to 3 in a large skillet).
        </li>
        <li>
          Cook until surface of pancakes have some bubbles and a few have burst,
          1 to 2 minutes. Flip carefully with a thin spatula, and cook until
          browned on the underside, 1 to 2 minutes more. Transfer to a baking
          sheet or platter; cover loosely with aluminum foil, and keep warm in
          oven. Continue with more oil and remaining batter. (You'll have 12 to
          15 pancakes.) Serve warm, with desired toppings.
